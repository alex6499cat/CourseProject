1854| I love the sky lounge access. Thank you. Imagine if they had a "dark or more dim room" to relax. That's next level!!
1858| just don’t know what I gotta do to not be treated like crap. Apparently spending thousands on your Amex isn’t cutting it.
1863| booked a code share Korean Air flight on

3833| nice to know that you bend over your paying customers and don't offer any help with important changes. Absolute JOKE
3885| Your website comment form makes return trip a required field set. That's a problem for asking questions about 1-way flights.
4991| Your contact website isn’t working. It kept telling me to enter my street address, even though it was there! How can I contact you?
4993| Is it possible to receive a copy of a boarding pass from an old flight? I need it for business.

12057| pay for baggage to go in the hold and no bags arrive because the plane hold is “too small” what a absolute joke!! #delta #airlines
12065| your airline and ticketing process is a nightmare. Why would you assign me two seats separate from one another, when I ordered both tickets at the same time, on the same account, in the same order? How does that make sense? You're a greedy unethical company.
13243| landed in PHL on flight 2097 this afternoon and just realized I left my Kindle in seat 3A.  How do I find/claim it?
13272| hi. I've just received a skymiles card from Amex. How can I check my skymiles account using the number on the card?

18224| it's been spooky at LAX tonight but nothing is as scary as the pseudo SW attempt at boarding. Folks don't get it. Too many ppl. 
18229|, just got on DL1908 and it reeks of pee.
19240| I received miles for outbound flight on KLM in sept but not return flight, how can I get those points?
20792| just landed in Seoul from ATL and must say the crew in delta one for this flight was outstanding especially Anita!
24603| Just to make sure, this price is for all three flights? Of just 1 of them? 
26002| you know what irritating? When your flight is delayed and likely to miss connector bc flight attendants can't get out of bed. DL3424

29601| Flying up to #NYC...Quick stop   #2018SBChallenge ...Keynote   luncheon #Tacklinglungcancer #LCAM 
30095| booking agent's mistake and despite the highest status, i don't even show up on the upgrade list.

34763| Hi, would a backpack measuring 13.5" x 17" x 6" be a carry-on, or would I have to check it? Cheers!
38330| 
38333| Flying between Miami  Cuba (Havana) is baggage included in the flight? If not please can you send me the link to add baggage? Thanks

41782|  Hi, I just checked in for my flight tomorrow. It says I’m confirmed but on the standby list. What does that mean? Thanks.
41791| su servicio de atención al cliente es pésimo. Hace días que envié un correo y no recibo respuesta, ni por teléfono ni por correo.
43465|  25 to depart 3505 no aircraft no delay posted. Who you kidding ? No announce in gate about no a/c. Poor communication

44492| Disgusted at your customer service at Gate 34C at Lagurdia service to Louisville KY tonight. Your gate agent was beyond rude when I had a simple question. Unreal. I've never been so disrespected in front of a group of people.
44709| - I’m trying to give you money  but can’t get logged into my sky miles account. Changed password, followed prompts, still no luck.
45778| Don’t be condescending when asking passengers if they can speak English.
46670| thank you for the #Upgrade Loving this row to myself OMW to San Fran! ️ #keepclimbing (hopefully achieving platinum today) #Delta
46673| continues to have the best customer service (and best inflight experience) of any US domestic airline. Great phone call last night.
46675| just keeps adding more and more value to the airline, huh.
46686| why can’t you honor a price in cart? Had a flight set to buy and price changes when I click ‘complete’. No online seller does this
46701| can someone explain to me why my seats still haven't been upgraded to first class? Within 5 days from departure and still open seats
46715| attempting 2 buy this flight but keeps changing price @ payment. Try again 4x, still available @ $738. What gives? 
48604|  I abhor having to line up in queue to board flights like some sort of cattle. Gate agents don’t enforce them anyway.
48620| thanks to the passenger in front of me for telling the flight crewman he is out of line for reprimanding me.
48626| in NOLA just messed up. It was 10 min past our boarding time and they announced a gate change that requires our entire plane to go back through security.
48634| needs to get there act together. One issue after another trying to get to from HPN to MSY. #stopoverbookingeveryflight

48649| Trying to change my flight from MSY to MSP from 11/27 to 11/28 but the website keeps giving me errors.
48663| should offer this as a service. "Have your book read to you by Jeff Goldblum." I'd pay extra for that. 
48672| CS not good.  Bait and switch on seats
49246| bigger issue, plane was in LIT overnight. Lots of time to discover problem and get new plane. Left in a huge expensive lurch.
49268| I was reminded today why I don't fly you. Gate change, late fly, no notification, missed meetings. Sorry they booked me to fly with u
50190| why is DL 6308 from DCA to RDU delayed?

59721| great flight crew on DL0040 LAX-JFK. Great service and very friendly.
59723|  your baggage drop line has doubled - hasn’t moved - in 20 minutes while 1 employee has been assisting 1 family. Unacceptable.
59725| trying to book  it shows me a price 1700, however when i put in my credit card, the price jumps to 2700, isnt this a bit too much
60389| any idea why DL5335 is still stuck on the tarmac? Atl-shv.

61199| , I just spoke with the most delightful disability services rep, Trish. GIVE THAT GIRL A RAISE! She was awesome 
61205| If I am flying first class on connecting flight but not first flight, do I pay luggage fees? All airlines are Delta.
61212| why isnt gate checking my bag an option when your overhead bins run out of space? Have you been to IAD’s baggage claim? It’s terrible
61227| I know it’s snowing at MSP, but it wouldn’t kill the flight crew to keep us informed abt delay on DL3438 - 35 mins  counting.
61229| thank you for Victoria and Jeremy at the  this morning for the amazing service. I’m eternally grateful ️️
61238| help
61254|  on oct 30 delta kept boarding and deboading and rebooking me on DL2107 for maintenance issues and delayed my trip by 10+ hrs.

74942| please can you advise a UK number or email address? I need confirmation of a delayed flight to get insurance claim and you have NO contact email address for me to choose. Please help
76362| Quite sad you run out of #vegetarian meals on an only ~80% full transoceanic flight. I'm eating 3 sidedish-salads while you offer 2 different chicken dishes.. Your offer feels like the ones 20 years ago, very disappointed!
76372| hi I'm flying to Atlanta on flight 0075 at 13:15 from AMS, in Atlanta I have 1 hour and 25 min to take a plane to Nashville. They told me need to pick up suitcase first and take the other plane. Would my suitcase come as first?
76375| As I said in my previous tweets, I have moved. I went to change my address, but the country I’ve moved to is not listed. Please help.

77820|: where should FOs check in at ATL domestic? 
77827| My bag was absolutely destroyed last night on flight DL 4681.  No Delta person was in sight when I retrieved it.  Flown hundreds of thousands of miles with you, but this left a bad taste in my mouth.  Thousands of dollars worth of damage.  I need assistance! 
77838| the little things like setting out coffee and breakfast bars while waiting to board in am are why I'm a loyal customer. Thanks!
79582| when three flights are departing at the same time the gate agents need to state which flight is boarding, not just call out the zone. Made for a much more confusing boarding process. #RSW
79594| generously credited FF miles after my cross country flight without wifi and inseat entertainment.  #confused as to why I got the same credit after paying for 4 ticketed travelers that a single traveler got.  #notfaircredit
79600| hiya guys who’s on the twitter team today?
81040| Thanks for your support. You guys rock!
83835| ONCE AGAIN you have messed up my travels plans AND blamed me for your mistakes. Your Agent Hernina of Salt Lake City, a supervisor was unhelpful, rude, cut me off and provided no customer service satisfaction whatsoever. #fail #deltafail
83845| you for sure have one of the best airline clubs out there.  Delta Sky Club at Newark Airport is wonderful.
83847| Not enough credit is given for a job well done.  You minimized or even waived change fees so my friend's wife could get home in time to bury our friend.  Sometimes, it's just the right thing to do.  thank you Delta.
83849| I need assistance as soon as possible please!!!!! 
86471| I booked a roundtrip flight. If I miss my outbound, can I still take my return flight?
86487| never fails... to disappoint me every single time I fly with them. Sitting on the tarmac in ATL with a broken plane and broken video system when we should have left an hour ago. ‍️
86496| why did the gate agent force me to check my bag when there IS SPACE in the overhead bins!!!! I am FURIOUS. And my bag better be there when I get there. I am so unhappy I have to wonder if my bag will be there. It’s nerve wrecking
86498| can I get some help in posting miles for flights flown?
86515| I will be surprising my kids (2  7 yr old) with their very 1st airline tickets for Christmas - any fun ideas on how to surprise them
86521| 12 minutes to check a bag at the Sky Priority PHX. Normal line faster.  
86523| You should train your employees that if someone is at the machine checking in to leave them alone. I was harassed by your employees because I preferred to use the kiosk. What's the point of the kiosk if you're still going to harass me?
89810| flying back home to new york from mexico tomorrow. trying to check in through the app right now. won’t let me finish because i don’t have a return date... i don’t have a return date because i live in new york. help?

91758| between a dent in a #plane, a missing part, #flight attendant issues, now an #engine that won’t start. Past 2 weeks = 15hrs in delays. I’m getting so sick of flying with you. Only so many “sorry for trouble” someone can take before switching #airlines.
91762| The app isn’t working! It logged me out and won’t let me login. I reset my password on the delta website so I know it’s right. It gets stuck on the loading screen  then gives an error. Any idea what’s going on?
91767| what is going on with the new update on iOS? Having some issues checking in etc. for an upcoming flight.
94123| follow me
94126| can u tell me why someone would need to use a kiosk to check in for a flight instead of using the online portal?
94135| I love you.
94146| I used to be a frequent flyer, but the seat pitch has gotten so ridiculous and pricing hasn't shrank like my legroom, that I'll fly with others.
94150| why does you app checkin/ upgrade not work for 2 hours now?
94162| I had very good customer service this morning from Jane B. in Indianapolis. She was full of energy and a welcomed encounter early in the morning.

97718| best airline in the world! But I am a New Diamond with the worse first experience. Upgrade denied. Why? BC You change the flight code
97723| your basic economy tickets are a joke. They are not cheaper than other airlines and you offer no way to upgrade them. I was trying to make my connection but not sure if I will #deltaistheworst #notflyingthemagain #missingchristmas
97727| please know that Ken in Skymiles support could not have been nicer or more helpful today. It is so appreciated.
97743| I'm hoping to speak to someone about a credit voucher...is there a chat or best # to call
97751| just spent 10 minutes playing the "Who is going to talk first" game with one of your customer service reps.  After 10min of silence he just transfers me to a customer service survey.  Great job delta... #FlySouthwest

97775| I'd like to book my little sister a flight to join us for a trip. She has a 2 yr old. Does the baby need a separate ticket? She would never sit in her own seat lol. She's a super tiny 2 yr old. Not even 20 lbs  Thanks!

104202| stop wasting your money on celebrity chefs. No one gives a fuck.  What people do care about is when the food is served is it fresh and edible? In the case of Delta One Intl.  is day NOPE.  Stale fruit and poorly managed food and beverage
104205| I need help with a schedule change
104217| stole my passport. Left in the back of the seat in front of me with the magazines. Reported it asap to THREE departments and two weeks later they still can't find. Impossible. #thieves @delta
104222| I figured it out. Since I wasn’t told about Thrifty’s deposit via your website when I booked you owe me $163.
102256| I have a miles question.  I just bought 2 tickets with miles and cash.  Does the cash go toward my MQDs?
104246| Very unfair business practice just after I have clicked purchase for flight of $833Uh-oh! We're sorry, but it looks like there's high demand for this flight. The originally quoted fare increased to $1,347.16 (USD).     To book at this price, select "Continue" to purchase
104737| flight Rome-NYC if my luggage is overweight how much do I pay? thank you.
106517| Trying all day to book an international flight, only getting error messages! What is the problem? ?

110200| best float presentation of the Macy's #ThanksgivingDay parade. For so many reasons. Thank you!
110204| I hope you know your ruined thanksgiving today for a lot of families. Maybe re-evaluate the way you communicate with all parties involved in the airline and improve your services by actually understanding the concerns and needs of your customers, thank youu
110206| team, thank you for sacrificing your time with your families so I could make it home to spend it with mine! Great crew today!
110208| If you had deliberately set out to design the most uncomfortable flight, you couldn't have made it worse than DL3850. Not the fault of the crew, it's the merciless crowding of the aircraft.
112135| Thank you for making us miss Thanksgiving with our family!!  Flight 4815 out of Vegas delayed...  #thanksnotthanks #fail
112184| thank you for making me miss my dad's funeral. You're the best

116749| 300 ticket. cancelled 10 hours later, yet you refuse to give me my money back. Plz help. Happy TG all
116764| BOI ticket agent a lot to be desired. Zero customers, attitude, no priority tags, put out to do seat assignments? True anomaly of Delta worldwide ‘17.
119157| while most people are are already at home with their family and friends, your HARDWORKING agents from RES to Inflight to ACS and OCC  are continuously working 24/7 365 to run a top notch airline. KUDOS to you all!!! Happy Thanksgiving!!!#Keepclimbing#werebetteranditshows
119165| on flight 1140 LAX-ATL excellent crew #greatservice #thankyou #bestofthebest #ThanksgivingDay

121178| Do your Sky Priority baggage tags even mean anything? Still waiting for my suitcase...
122117| hi folks, i just send you a DM as i need you to check something. Thanks!
122121| got any black friday deals
122143| can you confirm that purchases of non-MQM miles count toward MQDs? I'm a tad short on MQDs and am trying to figure out how best to fix that.
122166| making people pay for beer in the business class lounge? Not cool.
124164| we've been waiting 7 hours for a part to fly from Seattle. 150 nice people trying to see their families on Thanksgiving- just get us another plane! Your company is looking cruel and greedy. #delayeld
124167| if I'm traveling with a +1, please tag their baggage as sky priority so we don't both have to wait at baggage claim
124172| - You really made my active duty Marine cousin pay for his checked baggage? Unacceptable. #Delta #military #disrespectful
124907|..painful, painful travel delay in SEA from MSP to Maui. Longest flight delay I have ever experienced. Hoping we go but liklihood of an overnight delay is ever so close. This delay really, really, really hurts!
124912| #racialfavoritism. #1 standby list but GA clears at least 4 preferred passengers below me. This is how Delta thanks 3 year platinum and a current gold medallion on #Thanksgivingday. How is this different from involuntary bumping? Stop #inequality. Totally unacceptable.
126213| the flight to Maui is delayed 6:30 hrs.. No ones here has any answers... thanks for spoiling everyones much awaited vacation, this is really frustating...not expected from airline like delta
126226| what ur policy for dog travel??
126935| Hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving ️ 
127495| has the most comfortable seats I’ve been on on a plane in years. Soft and a descent size. 
127499| (cont) needless to say it is still not booked properly and on phone with third associate now
127501| Customer Care sent me a $25 delta choice credit to make up for an issue...however I just tried to use it and it says it expired earlier this month. How can it be fair that you only give 60 DAYS to use something you give passengers to make up for a problem??
128215| DL1397 where is it??! Waiting on my husband to arrive in Maui on a holiday, he missed his rental car pick up, and Thanksgiving with our family. It is insane that this is possible
128883| I book with someone directly? 
129271| I have officially spent my entire Thanksgiving with you. Do the right thing. That's all I ask in the future when you have multiple planes sitting on the ground in front of people on a 10 hour delay. 
129789| which terminal do you fly out of from Heathrow ?? And can you check your luggage in the day before flight or is it on day only??
130430| I lost my wallet on flight 1639 from SAN-ATL on 11/22. My name is Lila Weiss. My ID is in it so you can verify it is mine. All my cards in it, etc. Please help me find this! Thank you.
130950| - platinum here. Just received the WORST customer service I've ever had. Eli - online supervisor in Dallas TX had zero clue about any of Delta's policies. I had to show him your own policies on the website! Wasted an hour of my life. Beyond frustrated.
131906| good day. My delta app closed out and I lost my already signed in status and I can't remember my password/answers to my questions. What should I do?
131909| Outstanding service from every member of the Delta One team on flight 16 today. Efficient, friendly, attentive.
132690| #EpicFail on #CarryOn.  Today leaving #CDG we were boarding #SkyPriority and amongst… 
132695| On our flight yesterday, my wife and I were both automatically upgraded to Delta Comfort+, which was great, except we were no longer seated together. Is there a profile or reservation setting where I can request only upgrades that won't separate adjacent seats?
140221| Please bring back Splenda for our coffee! Thanks.
141353| hello do you have a working uk customer services number
141358| how do I fix this on iPhone X / iOS 11?  Can't add my boarding pass to wallet.  Other flights have worked fine. 
141360| what time do your agents show up for Bag Drop at LAX?  You've got 100 people waiting to check bags with no Delta reps.
143154| morning! Just landed in seattle and still on plane... next flight already boarding yikes!
143159| agent Kavetta at DFW E12 was a refreshingly fantastic start to our morning. And I'm sorry for getting her name terribly wrong.
143161| My SkyMiles Express card doesn’t seem to be linked to my delta account, and I never received the promotional miles (50k when I signed up). Help?
143214| what does this mean and why can I not change my seat? 
143216| I appreciated having my kneee banged twice by the service cart, only to have you end service with 27A-C when I was in 27D.
144539| nice armrests you got here 
144551| hi. This page in your app has been riddled with problems for years. Fares in the five figures or page errors. Can you pass to team? Reported this in past but so buggy. Help! Need this page!! Have a great day. 
146036| you guys gave me a 200$ voucher but no way to apply it when buying a new ticket in the new app. Seems like a slight oversight...
147552| my 56 min flight yesterday from RDU to Durham was likely my worst airline experience ever.
147571| mimosas.. a good way to start off my vacation. #firstclassflying #cancunorbust 
149642| kudos a to Case Keating TLH for best customer service ever! #delta
149651| Your gate agent for DL1429 made me gate check carry-on for baggage claim when there are multiple bins wide open on board. Plenty of space. Not cool. 
149657| I submitted an email request on your website on Oct. 18, 2017, Case Number, 25612729, and did not receive a reply after 30 days. Please respond. Thanks.
150814| I’m on the same itinerary as my wife, and both the Delta website and iPhone app are refusing to let me check in. Her boarding pass is showing in the app. Mine should be “automatically” checked in now, correct?
152355| I’m on flight 5557 HPN to Atlanta. I’m on the upgrade list but not upgraded - there are THREE seats open in the first class cabin. Why wasn’t I (or anyone) upgraded to those seats? I asked the flight attendants, they told me to contact Delta.
153938| can you clarify why my latest Delta flight purchase didn’t qualify for MQDs just because I bought the flight for another family member?
153953| shout out to Asha at the bar at Delta skyclub. Always awesome service! Please pass along to the manager.
155424| come on get it together flt 064 is delayed because Delta can not get the inbound international flight cleared. #deltaneedstogetittogether

155449| can i get a follow back please :(
155455| Today is my second time flying with Captain George (callsign Hollywood). This guy is hilarious and deserves a raise!
155457| Airlines is always such a disaster in SLC, l love flying Delta but try so hard to Avoid SLC the terminal is so small and crowded, Always a maintenance issue that causes us to sit here and go no where.  Figure it out SLC!!  #tiredofsittingintheplane
155470| Hi, I was wondering if there is a way I can be added to the upgrade list for an upcoming flight? Sorry, I’m not really sure how it all works. Thank you!
157092| why am I on the standby list?! my fare was not a standby fare. I have to get back home to be at work on Monday.
157105|... the worst flying experience (again) second time they have completely disregarded my military circumstances and I’ve had to book flights with another airline
157108| can you spot me $2? Would like to have at least a shred of status next year :) 
157118| Hi! Can you please check this booking number GFJNMK ? Can I request a refund? Urgent. Thanks
157144|  Was not impressed to discover you employ racist boarding staff. My father was almost preventing boarding last night for no reason - Until I stepped in. It's a good thing I look white  expect a complaint shortly #deltaairlines  #racismisaliveandwell

224177| it was a short flight 7380 tonight, but the crew was fantastic and we flew into a fantastic view off the wing! 
225088| Time to rethink if @delta is concerned about gold members. WAiting in endless economy line-"helpfully" directed here. Stupid
225587| hope you're part of that plan! Add new flights to COS! Hopefully from MSP or DTW...it's a Skywest hub too!  
225669| can you see if I can switch to DL4740 tomorrow? (conf hrfgme)

227808| can't wait for my flight

229242| you customer service sucks and all you do is lie, I'll never fly your airline again!
229244| thank you for getting me on the 1:20 flight from MCO to ATL. This birthday girl is glad to be getting home from her biz trip early 
229248| flight cancelled, stranded in another city so had to book hotel, but no hotel comp or voucher?!! Not even a small flight credit for the inconvenience?!  I'm shocked by your customer service.  Waiving a change fee is not good enough, that should just be step one. #Delta
230051| want to checkin for delta op flt but redirected to AirFrance site, im silver status but cant upgrade to delta+, please advise!
232307| at bag drop Las Vegas - where is the staff? No one servicing the sky priority line. The line is growing
232321| when I can make it thru security faster than I can check my bags I may be loyal to the wrong airline. 
232772| thanks for the upgrade. Best airline.
233195| Good morning! Recently got married and need to change my name on Sky Miles acct. Can you help? Thx!
233197| Any chance I could ride standby on earlier flight from Sacramento to KC today?

233858| thank you SO MUCH for finding my lost phone  mailing it to me! You helped save tons of family photos, like this one. I am so happy  
233861| What's the deal with Marketplace? Regularly scheduled maintenance taking several days? 
233875| Hi! Wondering if you could help me with terminology on my booking? Logged in to acc to check (cont) 
234617| 30 mins into flight  I'm now Silver status!! Where's the balloons? Where's the parade? #chasinggoldbaby #firstclassonreturntripmaybe
235235| what does it mean when I check-in to a flight and it tells me I won't get my seat until I get to my gate??
235237|  Kudos to ATL E-32 gate agent Eric Taylor. He handled an irate, aggressive pax with class and professionalism.

236339| Hi, Delta. I have a big problem with my check in
236344| are you guys buying an Airbus 380 anytime soon? I want to go to Europe this winter but I was hoping fly out in that lol
236353| there is an issue with your mobile app syncing check-ins across multiple devices. Personal phone says yes, cooperate one says no.
236361| your online check-in doesn't support hyphens in last names, making it impossible to check in online. Bug! Put it in the queue!
237988| plenty of room on board, too. #badservice #rudeemployees #deltaisbad 
240835|  I have a really tight connection at MSP today from DL728 to DL200 help so I don’t miss the flight !
242552| can’t believe I cannot upgrade my seats cos the tkts I bought were basic ! Beware when u purchase tkts
243016| SMF flt 4597 gate agents and flight attendants allow pxg TWO bags in overhead.  Why ?  Fair ?
243394| - Salads have dressing already on them? There was no dressing on this salad at all. Bone dry. I've had separate dressing before.
243397| lines at bag drip for RDU are getting longer - have been here for 15mins already, only 1 person on bag drop. Not great
243400| a heads-up that I just smashed my head on this thing. Awful design and should be removed from the planes. #ouch 
243408| 2 for 2 flight delays to and from ATL and MONTGOMERY. 10 month old can't wait in an air port for 7 hours. Really expensive uber rides
244378| twice requested and did not receive automated call back. What gives.
244380| Can you please explain to me why your flight attendants refused to give my baby milk on a flight this morning? Unacceptable.
245441| what is going on at SJO? Have flight from LAX tonight?
245444| what is the process in getting a gate pass?
245449| Getting rid of comp upgrades for loyal customers seems to imply that the loyalty only flows in one direction.
246030| we received an email for our flight Saturday that we can use iMessage for free; is this a thing for all flights going forward?
246033| Can someone please answer my DM? I would love to speak to someone directly from the Tampa Bay support team
247191| I’ll be traveling soon and I was wondering, are all your planes retro fitted with IFE’s?
247199| looking forward to flying yall tomorrow! #weddingseason
247693| hello I have had 2 separate 12+ hour delays on Delta within 30 day period.  The delays have cost me thousands of dollars of lost business and time.  Delta finally resolved one of cases but case #00153949 was submitted long ago and still zero response.  Please assist
247698| Help please. Flight cancelled to Liberia, Costa Rica (2 days) and getting the run around from the helpline. Just want a vacation!

266098| Why was I interviewed by security people before checking in for one of your flights at YYJ?
266101| fam you have to do better. Why is DL4246 changing gates so many times? It's annoying to have to change terminals. #dobetter
266121| :  Still confused as to why I can’t change seats prior to or at the gate when I see people assigned seats after my attempts.
266137|   Sitting here like a rat in an Atlanta trap for 30 min they can't get jetway to connect to plane   people missing connections

266948| How exactly does the Delta credit card work?
266955| Hey guys, looking fwh to our flights home from Honeymoon with you tomorrow! I'm sure ur crew will b at least as nice as outb flights!
267359| odds of anything being done to compensate for landing at 645 and sitting here til 8?  crushing it...
267363| very upset that Delta ruined my vacation by making multiple errors and then insulted me with a ridiculous offer to make it right.
267369| Seems as if the early boarding and moving us from our flight didn’t warrant an apology for inconvenience.
268261| please help! I am an avid promoter of your airline as I usually receive excellent service.  Today, was an unfortunate exception
268267| just gave me 600 dollars to take a different flight to LA 3 hours after my original booking. A1 customer service.

269184| John, great flight attendant on 2339 in first class. Funny, fast, great service. Feedback form clunky/cumbersome, hence the tweet.

269533| The absolute Worst experience ever in accommodations as well as customer support. NEVER receiving my business again in this LIFETIME!

410583|: Kudos to the first class flight attendant on flt 2811 from ATL&gt;DCA. Couldn’t catch her name, but she is awesome. Hire more like her!
410585| I'm flying ABQ-&gt;ATL-&gt;AMS-&gt;BOM on a business class ticket.  Does that entitle me to use the lounge at ATL and AMS?
410594| hi, how many carry on a I can take into my flight?

410624| gate D11 at LGA boarding flight 1832 didn’t realize that the pilots weren’t on board!?!? Scary
411177| 5855 from Pittsburgh to LGA was hust cancelled. Is there a flight to Newark or Kennedy tonight?
411179| Terrible service. Staff screaming at each other. Flight was cancelled with no notice and no compensation or help. What. the. heck.
411181| your lax terminal is already a disaster. This is icing on the cake. Looking forward to a long layover with infant without sky club.
411183| 1110 from Orlando to ATL defines idiocy.
411186| has a good #Kind granola bar.  #GlutenFree too. 
411188| no luck resolving a Delta-created issue with name and flt# mismatch that means forced to check in at PDX. So frustrating, #DoBetter

411568| you need to seriously take a look into your change fee policy. $200 per change is more than gratuitous.

411927| we have a plane and no crew. SEND US A CREW
411934| my flight from IND to JFK was cancelled today. Will I have to pay to check my bag again for my rescheduled flight tomorrow?

412404| great. Now you hung up on me. Lousy service, DL.
412406| 2/2 Sue was professional and held her cool. The man in seat 1C on delta 0538 should NEVER have been allowed to board.
412409| why are y’all so violent with bags at RDU 
412418| DL410 lands JFK :41p. Now 8:20p. No bags. Unhappy.
412440| I love you, but tonight this is not actually happening and at a really bad time. 
412527| why call them GUC when there are no upgrades on code shares? Call them TransUC or something..#GKGCYI only one leg waitlists.. Done this 3 Times this year!! AF on sky team is a joke !
412535| needs to bring down these prices. Where are your Black Friday sales?!
412539| thanks for throwing my bag so hard a bottle of wine broke and ruined my clothes. Not to mention we even bubble wrapped it to prevent this. Be gentle 
412756| I was told that if I gave up my seat I would receive a 500$ amx gift card and a night at hotel. Now they’re giving me nothing. :(

415509| I'm filling in for a coworker on a basic economy flight...please tell me why I'm unable to upgrade seats?
415511| worst airline ever! 2 delays later, the pilot goes missing?! Been stuck for an hour. #DeltaAirlines #NYC -&gt; #FLL #1702
415813| I think it’s silly that I can’t pay you money to change to an earlier flight that isn’t fully booked (yes I bought basic economy)
415819| worst experience. Reached gate before 17min departure, suddenly my boarding pass disappeared from my app. Staff gave my comfort seat to someone else without any reason, even warned me of not letting me board the flight if I ask more questions
415824| why can't I log into the Fly Delta app, but can get into the Fly Delta website ? Samsung7 Same userid/skymiles number  pwd
416176| why all the cancellations to NYC today? From, stuck in Chicago

417899| Hi Delta. You're my favorite. Taking the red eye from SLC to NYC tonight. Any chance for a seat upgrade? If not, I'll luv u anyway
417903| I also want to thank the gate agent at A4.  I didn't get her name but she made me a priority on getting on the earlier flight.  Airlines catch a lot of flak lately, but you came thru when I needed it most. 2/2
418464| what’s the ETA on your site being back up and running?
418466| Airlines website and app down? 
418479| what is going on with the app and website? Ya'll delayed my flight by 4 hours and now when it is time to board, no boarding pass!!!!

419261| please see case #00138115 for details. I appreciate your looking into this horrible situation. 
419267| "Expediting" a bag into an understaffed baggage office doesn't do any good. Everyone on our flight has their bags while we wait.

419654| I lost my passport in the flight DL673 (From Atlanta to Quito), it's sure I forgot it in my seat (29D). I hope you can help me.

422774| Hi! I'm trying to link multiple bookings to my Delta/SkyMiles account. It finds my trips but never saves them. Can you help? Thanks!
423009| your loyalty program is so successful you might need to consider more priority checkpoints at JFK
423025| I have never experienced such useless service with my lost luggage! Will NEVER EVER fly Delta again

441531| Res agent just told me he didn't have time to help me, hung up when I asked to speak to his supervisor. I just wanted to upgrade.

446980| You’re The Best.#LGM

447923| crazy question - are you operating a 767-4 from CHS to ATL this afternoon?

448945| to say the staff on the ground at Santo Domingo was no help would be an understatement. Very disappointed customer right now.
448948| I’m unable to check in to my flight from LAS To SLC for tomorrow. I get a “check with an agent at the airport error.” My schedule is super tight tomorrow and I’m worried about delays. What gives?

450931| please pass along kudos and thanks to Antoine and Bridget B. In the Atlanta sky club. They are exactly what the world needs right now #classy #thoughtful #belikeantoine #belikebridget #DeltaAirlines
450934| If I purchase a mileage booster for flight I’m taking does this also increase MQM’s for the flight?
450965|  sitting in the Atlanta airport marveling at the constant positive energy and enthusiasm and genuine kindness coming from this man (and all of your staff). A true blessing. 
450973| waiting to do a thorough safety check until passengers are onboard, deplaning, and delaying two hours (when flights go LGA -- ORD every hour) is NOT acceptable. Especially when it was a suspected problem on the previous flight. Sincerely, a Diamond Medallion.
452156| Silver Elite Passengers are not allowed to use Priority CheckIn with codeshare partners like Korean Air. So much for benefits - stinks!
452182| i am unable to check in for my trip tomorrow :( app says there is a Pb and website says access denied :(
452185| do you give discount for groups of 10 or more?Thanks!
452187| why won’t the app let me change my seat even though there are open seats available?
453529| need to be contacted immediately regarding my luggage. I have to sit in baggage claim for over two hours to wait for my luggage that  failed to load on my flight. 
453540| - standing here ready to board in zone 2 - two soldiers in uniforms standing behind me - no concession to allow them to board first?   Other airlines have that as standard procedure?

454742| need assistance with flight cancellation. Family illnesz
454745| you guys seriously need to evaluate your operations at TLH. Boarding took forever, the plane just messed up on the runway, you guys fixed it but now we have to wait another 30 minutes for takeoff? I’m praying that I can make my connection to DEN in ATL now.
454752| why is it ALWAYS something?ALWAYS!! 
454759| - just had the BEST flight crew ever from LGA to GSO on Flight 5373. Even though we were late departing LGA the flight crew was excellent. It's because of flight attendants like this that we'll continue flying Delta!
454762| Can i get some assistance that doesn't take 2 hours?  It appears that I am checked in, and I never checked in.
455661| called 24+ hours before flight for special meal and was told I couldn’t book it until *less* than 24 hours before flight. Call today and told I can’t book meal less than 24 hours before flight. What am I meant to eat during my long haul flight?
455666| Hi, I sent you an email on 2nd November (case no 00343098, ref: _00D1aY3af._5001aQ9QOd). I understand you have a backlog of cases so won’t be responding within 30 days, but do you know roughly when I can expect the response please?
456879| I’ve been an incredibly loyal customer of yours for the last 10 years. Medallion status, maybe I’ve booked 1 flight on alt airline in last decade and I work for one of your biggest clients in the world. After tonight, will never fly on your planes again. Only unhelpful.
456891| been sitting on the runway for almost an hour in CLT because you lost our flight attendants bag. How are you addressing that?
456893| are you guys increasing business class awards to Europe, again??? Hard to know without an award chart, but only 85k one ways are showing.

459177| I encountered one of the most kind and courteous flight attendants today on Delta flight 1869 from Montreal to Atlanta. Melanie Sarver’s demeanor was the perfect mashup of southern charm and exemplary customer service!
460207| I was in the process of booking a flight on  5 minutes) the required skymiles went from 50,500 miles per ticket to 60,500. Unbelievable!
460314| forget the warm wet towels, can we get some sanitation wipes for the trays?  #notmycrumbs 
461695| your check in procedure and efficiency at PVG is the worst I have ever seen in 30 years of travel with your airline.
461697|, I’ve been held up boarding at least twice recently because some of your agents don’t know that a NEXUS card is valid documentation for flights to Canada; both times they had to call a manager to get a simple “yes”. Including it in passport training might help avoid this.
461699| if we opt @ check in to bid a different flight will we be required to do so or can we decline?
461701| Dane Count airport and crew of #1481 to DTW - awesome job getting to Detroit early. Making up a 50 minute delay on the inbound aircraft. @delta you never let me down. Thanks!

463605| can I get help changing flights faster than a 50 minute wait on the phone?
464489| why are your phones so backed up? Just wondering. I've been on hold for an hour. Patient but curious!
464498| Can I bring blu-rays, a mirror, and pins with me on a flight?
465274| If I book on Expedia will my MQMs be the same ?
466910| If I booked a flight under my wife's middle name (she goes by it) but her drivers license has her first name do I have to modify res?
467628| when did you change lounge access at Haneda to business class only?  A real slap in the face to Platinum Elite and especially Delta Reserve card holders.  Also as a business class passenger (and Diamond Medallion member) on business travel with a Plat. And Reserve it sucks

470334|, normally I love flying with you, but I’m extremely upset at how your team acted tonight. A team-member unapologetically snatched my bag out of my hands after I was told to wait to see if there was space overhead. There was. I said no and I feel violated. I’m not alone.

504413|    How do you treat your. Customers? My friend had a disastrous. Experience with you , not right.   Treat your customers with respect and consideration! That is all
504418| This is just a question from two curious passengers. Why don’t Airlines board passengers from the back of the plane to the front? (Minus first class or premium passengers). Wouldn’t that be more efficient with time and space? Just curious!
506128| Hi; could you please tell me which routes will you have for Russia 2018? ️️
506130| my grandparents are traveling internationally after 3 years tomorrow with a total travel of more than 18 hours  with a flight to boston tomorrow with you guys. can you make sure they have an incredible experience?
506133| your company sucks.  U overbook and r always late!
506141| literally still sitting on ground while a pilot and flight attendant argue over who is getting the “jump seat”  that’s embarrassing - do your dirty laundry behind closed doors, before take scheduled take off DL1998 ATL to MIA
506153| I currently have gold medallion status, but if I were to book a trip for April 2018 now, would I get free baggage check for said trip with my status resetting Jan. 1st?
506156| wish I knew where my 3 bags are. Agent promised update hours ago. Wondering how much I’ll have to spend on clothestoiletries before meetings...what’s platinum for??
507505| does no one proofread these ads? 
507517| thanks for providing the best flight today I’ve had all year! One more to go then home for the holidays️️
507521| My flight 447 was delayed like crazy today and the gate agents/crew were all absolutely incredible under the pressure of the angry mob. I would have cried and quit a thousand times. They deserve the highest praise.
507523| - got a phone message to call you back about a reservation I never made, uncovering $2k worth of fraudulent airline tickets purchased on my card. I've reported to my credit card company and closed the account. Thanks for the heads up! So glad for the phone call :)
507530| Need some help with a reservation change and I got told by the animated system for Delta that it will take 65-75 minutes to get a return call. Can I simply inbox someone here? I need to just change a reservation please and the website won't let me do it.
508937| Good Afternoon! Any chance of moving to an aisle seat on 1597 tonight? I torqued my knee and would prefer to be able to stretch it out a bit if possible.
508951| Thanks for the poor customer service today.  Arrived 3 hrs early for int flight and bags still didn’t get on plane. Then tried to get earlier connection home and was told $75..pay for first class and get low class service.  Here’s to a 20 hr travel day!!!!
508962| about to lose a sky mike member
510605| Thank you to your great counter representatives at Huntsville International as they helped this late passenger make her flight.  #deltacares
510609| has done it right with the Comfort class
510620| you really gotta work on your customer service game... 5 hour flight EWR to Salt Lake City - “limited” in flight WiFi, no outlets, team members with poor attitudes.. and the app is buggy/dysfunctional. What’s going on?
510629| why does the row after Comfort+ ends have less space than the rows behind it. Can’t even fit my laptop and extend my elbows to type.
510633| Brilliant service on the AMS-MSP flight today, staff were fantastic and lovely. I actually didn’t want the flight to end! Thank you!
510645| Hi, I cannot check-in using the app because it tells me the date of birth and date of expiration of my passport are not valid. What is the problem here?
510649| Mustaf on DL467 from TLV to JFK provided absolutely outstanding service in delta one the entire flight. Hope he gets some recognition for it!
511853| if a sky miles member is flying business class on an international flight how many bags is he allowed to take
511855| paid an extra $50 per ticket so I can select my seats, yet the only seats available are exit row and delta comfort which cost extra. Nice scam you have going there.

514186| starting our trip on a bad note. Over 2 delay to fix a hose. It took 45 minutes for paperwork. Now we are stranded in Atlanta because we missed our connection flight to Munich. We got on a later flight through Paris (yeah, one more stop) but our party got split up as well.
515484| You guys need to do something about your electrical outlets. I’m on a plane that was new in February (Ship 3873) and the outlets are already too loose to use reliably.
515488| can someone please help me???

516784| who do I contact if I think my MQMs from a flight were not posted correctly?
516789| stop trying to sling credit cards as I watch HBO.

516815| DL201 JNB to ATL 11/25/2017 - stayed on tarmac for 4+ hours. Extraordinarily bad. No apologies, nothing.. very disappointing!

518971| really? A maintenance delay  gate change? Why aren’t realistic times gates posted? Johnson 1005909310
518983| worst customer service ever. Vicky yelled at us, interrupted us, was rude. Chris hung up on a conference call with us/WestJet/choiceair because “it’s not deltas fault”. Yes it was. Admit when you’re wrong and find a solution. After 14 hours,  saved the day for us.
518989| Hum, a flight that I never bought appears on my app and on the website? It doesn't appear on my credit card statement either... help me please?
518996| all the flight that I've been on today or been scheduled to be (had to rearrange my flights twice already) have been delayed... what gives huh?

519933| Very unpleasant flight from PDX to AMS on Nov3017. Husbands video player was broken and it was the hottest flight.  No air.  Miserable!
519944| Traveled “home” to see my parents  got a baby gift. Can I “check” this? (Dimensions = 32 x 17 x 7, Weight = 20lbs) 
519948| every time I travel with you there is a delay, over an hour this time and the only beverage passed out was pretty filled water cups ???
519951| so only h2o in delta comfort now on a 1:10 flt. Thanks for “upgrading” me from my preferred window seat to the middle and I can’t even get an OJ when I asked then a rude flt attendant that told me to “fly AA”. Thanks, think I will next year. Glad to know my 25k$ is nothing
519961| Why is there a 2HR wait time to talk to an agent
519971| i have an international flight scheduled for January - if i wanted to switch dates, how much will it cost me?
519976| 2 hour flight delay. Weather’s fine. No excuse. Arriving past midnight. No apologies, no compensation. Thanks. For horrible service.
519979| been waiting over 5 hr for help with account numerous calls with 2 hour waits and no promised call back and think 2 hr on hold times is rediculous
520882| all that sass your flight attendants had rushing us to take our seats. We seated and ready to go and now the plane needs fuel. Like who forgot that lol WE LATE FOREAL NOW
520889| worst time ever flying from . Delayed no reason. Missed connection flight. very rude employee “station manager” on flight
521832| odd question: close to medallion status for 1st time but I know (because of work) next year won't be a travel year. Is it possible to defer status? Don't want to aim for $ spend or do a mileage run if I won't get to use the status or re-earn anyway. Thanks!
521840| I was just upgraded to FC for a flight tomrw (silver med). Husb is on a sep reserv. There are FC seats; can he be upgraded too?

540386|  past 2 times I have flown out of GSP flight has messed up by faulty plane.  What’s the deal?  Then I call needing help re-routing and it will be 40 minutes before I can get a call back?  You can do better.

545968| my flights on Middle East airlines haven’t shown up on my skymiles account....I’m not sure what to do now. I found online I can mail boarding passes but that’s a hassle as I live in Europe 
545972| If a person boards early do to a surgery,  ur staff says they are going to help him-Don't ignore him, like u did my husband. A Man started serving first class drinks  ignored my husband's request for help. I guess drinks are more important? #MSP to #MCO this AM. #delta

550073| Um, still waiting to get off our plane in Columbus, Ohio. Been sitting for over 15 minutes. What's the point of arriving early only to sit here waiting for a  jetway so we can deboard? Is this another breakdown in communication? I want off this plane! SOS!
550075| 2 hours to receive a call back or be on hold for two hours to change my flight tomorrow ? Wow that’s horrible customer service. Unacceptable.
550079| You have got to be kidding me with this hour wait time.
551336|  is this really how you treat luggage that says FRAGILE? 
551342| for some reason my global entry/traveler number isn’t showing on my reservation. Help?

551363| making a difference with beautiful new planes, luxurious seats, state of the art entertainment and most importantly courtesy and humour.
551370| the gate agent for flight 868 from Minneapolis to Vegas was one of the best I have ever experienced. Employees like her make the experience much more enjoyable! Thank You!
552717| my last two flights aren’t registering my points in the app....help! 
552709| you need to review your partnership with gogo. They are not providing the service you believe they are. When it works it's subpar, and I'm now finding it's barely working at all. I've had multiple flight where the service is down. Make sure they aren't robbing you blind.
554181| GOLD MEDALLION!!! It’s LIT! ️️️️ #skypriority
554192| seriously? Two maintenance delays in one day? I always want to be safe but I'm tired, Delta. So ready to be home.
555509| why give a perk of Zone 1 with your credit card when you allow Zones 2  3 to board with Zone 1
557284| my good friend  left his laptop on a flight can you assist him
557286| - Why does your ticket and website say different things about your baggage allowance? Tried speaking with your team to resolve, but they're equally clueless!

558654| I just purchased Delta Comfort seats for myself and a few friends less than 5 minutes ago and as soon as I hung up, realized one friend only wanted the upgrade for one leg - not both! Is there any chance we alter this reservation since I just hung up with the rep?
558659| My flight has been canceled, can you explain my why
558661| Why is it literally every time I fly from Atlanta there are mechanical issues with your planes? Makes me want to avoid ATL. DL1390
560026| did a pretty good number on my  copilot bag today. Desk agent wasn’t much help either when I asked what could be done to address my issue. 
560028| the awesome crew of DL0072 from MCO to ATL made this little guy’s day! That’s a lot considering we just left Disney. #ThankYou #DeltaAirlines

561019|  Flight #4768why can’t your gate personnel provide proper communications???

561042| awesome job on flight 935 from syr ti atl. The crew was amazing.

562475| Thanks for getting me home on time to catch some  tonight. Very good experience.
562477| LGA Flt 5600 this is extremely bad, 2nd trip back to bus gates- ground crew forgot to plug in power- lousy experience
562479| I know it's a long shot, but would I be able to switch a nonrefundable flight? I need an earlier flight to ATL or later flight out. I anonymously donated bone marrow ~5 years ago and my recipient is in Atlanta. If I could arrange a longer layover we could finally meet!
562481| call time as a medallion is over 2 hours without an option for a call back. Please help!!! #Travel
563551| My boyfriend and I checked into our flight, and it has no info under seat. We're guaranteed seats, right? They just need to be assigned? I was hoping we'd be together, but we don't appear to be able to select two together.
563553| what is the cheapest RT flight out of Atlanta on Sunday 12/17.Need one flight to maintain status...
563558| I was trying to change my flight which was on December, 19th but I accidentally canceled the flight because my computer froze at the moment. I just want to know if I would be able to get my flight back.

564584| Kudos to Cassandra IND-DTW-MDW #bestflightattendantEVAH #grateful

566382| mother in law came from Germany to Atlanta to see her daughter.  Haven’t see each other in over a year.  She speaks no English. Her luggage remains in Germany.  You said it would be here the next day.  It wasn’t.  Now they can’t find it.  What will you do make this whole?!
566410| - it’s time for us to check in but your app won’t let us pick seats. What gives? #airlineproblems
566412| I need help with my reservation tomorrow but can't sit on hold for the hold time of 1hr 10 minutes
567219| You're still garbage. Can't believe you surge priced my flight in the 10 minutes it took me to start booking and hit pay. Hit pay only to see you've raised the price.
567221| you may often ponder why your guests never want to check their bag... this is why.... some of your careless employees.. I love flying  but this makes me second guess that. If this is how you treat luggage with our valuables. #youcandobetterthanthis 
567230|, why is this dinky-ass plane just sitting here?
567241| the check in counter team was awful today at the New Orleans Airport.  The agents need some serious customer service training.

568008| if I need to change my flight to head home early, what is the protocol?

569697| didn’t let me on my flight because they claimed I checked in too late. But I checked in two hours early. When I spoke to a manager to resolve the issue she said she had no obligation to do so and hung up on me. So I missed my flight and purchased @AmericanAir instead.

572705| if I want to do a status match challenge, what’s the easiest way? Can you all help if I provide documentation?
572712| why would you charge someone bag fees when they are flying business class on their second leg? Your website doesn't say free bags only if business class is the first leg of your flight. WTF?!
573246| I need to take flight .

583159| I’m. Medallion member choosing to go stand by..I didn’t realize this came with rude gate agents. I would have kept original flight in Comfort with Sky Priority boarding. #workoncustomerserviceforyourloyalcustomers

585212| Hello, how can my mother get her Skymiles number?
585221| Do you know why the app isn’t showing the upgrade list for flt 2768 tomorrow? It hasn’t shown it since I bought the ticket and I’m curious to know how many seats are left in first.
585240| Terminal Pretty Empty So Far  Plane Ontime-) #Yea 
585243| what's a loyal flyer have to do to get a upgrade ? I see lots of comfort plus seats available I am Gold status and still can't get upgraded I don't understand ? #DL2075 I love your airline just wish I could have some perks with it too when available.

588902| Where can I leave a review at ? Horribly disappointed in the way customer service treats passengers
588914| My flight from FRA to ATL is cancelled. You emailed me a helpdesk number for the US. I'm in Germany.
588918| your flight search is down on hone service. Can't you hire a few more customer service reps, and a better website development team?
590200| gate agents are such class acts, this is the way to give great customer service.
590202| I flew RDU to LAX on Friday and the app is currently saying no miles because the ticket was refunded. Any clue what happened? This was the flight that was supposed to secure my medallion status for 2018.
590212| flight 591 DTW-DCA flight attendant plays his trumpet as we deplane. Nice touch!
590214| are basic economy tickets eligible to be changed (I'm assuming with a change fee)?
591651| thank you for making me sleep at the airport #RockBottom
591665| Never fly delta! I can't change my flight due to an emergency, even though I bought insurance...

595248| I ️ U but...On a flight to NYC from MIA (DL1287). Smells like a dozen used diapers filled w/  INSIDE of this airplane. The flight attendants say there’s nothing they can do. I just hope I don’t smell like  once we land. Help!
595250| I'm trying to book a flight JFK-HAV; I will be traveling with my Guatemalan passport so I don't need a Visa, only a tourist card I can get at the HAV airport; but I can't book it from the page and at the CC they don't seem to be able to help... what can i do?
595252| Hey man, listen, I understand cancelling a flight because the plane is broken, but when you rebook me, can't you do something to ensure I get the same seats I chose? I choose the aisles because I'm a big person, not because I think it's cool.
596362|, this #LittleWifeBigLife usually sings your praises after one of my many trips with my girls. Today, however, I encountered a very rude stewardess by the name of Heather on DL2898 and I'm extremely disappointed in the service. I'm filing an official complaint online.
596364| Will you refund an infant in arms ticket (the tax and airport fees) since my infant will no longer be coming on our international trip?
596366| your maintenance response for issues in Grand Rapids is ridiculous. 2.5 hours we’ve been waiting for them to even GET HERE, let alone fix the issue. While we sit and wait and watch our boarding time get pushed further and further back 
597384| not sure who *TMS is at your Twitter account, but s/he saved the day.
597394| we are looking to book a large family, if we go basic economy is it reasonable to assume at least the children will be seated with an adult in our party not by themselves?
597406| The cookies are so addictive. Free inflight Wi-Fi,  rocks. #TeamPixel Love flying #DeltaAirlines 
597416|  when flying delta, try and fly their 737-900 aircraft!  Incredible, clean, quiet, comfortable, lighting is awesome, just an incredible experience!  Can’t wait for them to retire the d MD-80’s I don’t like flying on hem anymore. They were a great workhorse 30 yrs ago.
597430| Lousy service today. Flight #1710
597437| disappointed in you guys today, of all my flights with delta never had a screw up like this one, and can’t get any help either. Guess 2018 I’ll be picking a new airline to fly with.
597439| flight 1630 ATL to SAT on 12/2  737-9  incredible!  Seat 3D in 1st Class.  Gorgeous plane, newest technologies, crew was tons of fun  accommodated every request!  My beverage never went empty! Comfortable  Quiet.  I can’t get my $ out fast enough 2 fly 1st class
597443| Hello. I’m trying to get Skymiles for a recent trip I took with you that were not credited to my account . What is the US phone number that I should call to resolve this? Thanks.
598574| just boarding on flight from Detroit to shanghai. Ticket said in seat power available, but can’t find it, neither could flight attendant. Any help?
598578| has continued to impress me.  Their app even tells me when my bag gets loaded on my plane.
598581| - I'm quite surprised there is anything close to a correct passanger list  about how you just boarded this flight out of LaGuardia. Time to get an efficient, safer process. I just witnessed several of your customers including me floored at what just happened.
598583| Disappointed with delta online reservation. I always get an error with fare change after selecting the dates and submitting the payment. Looks like there is no sync between showing prices and booking flights.
598585| why could I check in through the Delta app but it won’t let me check in my husband? We’re flying back to the states from Europe
599507| can you help me change a reservation due to a flight delay/missed connection?
599509| how do I change my name on my skyline miles account? Got married and last name changed.
599519| flight 1359 deserves free WiFi
599521| What exactly does "Changable / NonRefundable" mean? If we cancel a flight, how long do we have to use the credit?  Also, is there a change fee?
600912| hi. questions.
600918| a policy to reconsider: I’m traveling with my minor nephew who wasn’t allowed into sky club because he doesn’t have an AMEX. . I’m not going to leave him out. Nor should I have to pay for him. He’s a kid. Club Agents were really nice, though!
600928| your 47 minute hold times are &gt; than your delays which tells me you don't staff to prevent foreseeable issues=I don't believe you.
600930| hello! I’ve checked in about 4 times now and still haven’t been sent my boarding passes for tomorrow :/
600934| you should forewarn consumers before flight that they will have no screens in front of them. Especially when its. 3+hr flight. This sucks!
600942|  cleanliness on planes is poor. Pillow just now was gross.Last flight seat was dirty. Ewww.
601884| hi, I’m trying to get on standby for an earlier flight home. Can you assist?
601886| ...Flight delayed, forcing missed connection and extra day. How does this happen to the same traveler on the same route two years in a row?
601892| Checking in for our SEA-SFO flight and being asked for passport or green card. Agent response when asked why is: “I don’t care about the legal mambo jumbo”. Then procedes to ask if I’m related to my husband, who isn’t on the same reservation ‍️
601894| First and last time flying with you. Never been so insulted in my entire life.
601897| I have 6 passengers in my itinerary. I’ve checked us in 3 times now via the app. I’m almost at the airport and can’t get any of our boarding passes. Please fix this!
601901| can the “happy man” at the term b skyclub in atl follow me everywhere.  Great welcome to the club!
601903| 17 delta comfort seats available on my flight and I’m SPG Platinum. Gate agent said I’d have to pay $200+ to get upgraded. Never happened any other time. What’s the deal? 19th delta flight since August.
601914| if i am flying first class to CUN from JFK am i able to use the delta sky club lounge? Thanks!
602860| can you help with my husband’s points from a recent trip?? Have not been processed yet.
602864| The condition of aircraft on Flight #483 today from JFK to SFO is unacceptable. Between the putrid smell, lack of in seat power, and ancient IFE and overall condition. This is not acceptable for a 6.5 hour flight.
602871| can you please help me find my missing miles from 
602873| very disappointed in your new Economy Basic fare class. I am sitting in SLC right now trying to move to an earlier flight to SEA. There are seats available on the earlier flight and I would pay $100 extra to change flights but I can't because of this fare class. Help!!
602877| I’ve been in Pittsburg all weekend for work, we ended early and I’m trying to fly out on 5:45. I’m booked on the 6:45, hoping arrive early and have a little Sunday without paying $75 change fee!!? The flight before us is wide open! Doesn’t make sense!
603623| What’s going on here?? On hold for 20 mins.  Nice service. 
603627| answer me. Why is this a policy to take pictures of passengers before they board a flight to Ghana?!  Why is this ok? #DeltaAirlines
603629|, thank you for your support of our military!  Every year I enjoy I spending time here when I pass through ATL. 
603631| love that y'all have in flight entertainment. Just wish it had closed captioning.
603638|  what’s the best way to carry on a wedding dress for destination wedding in the Dominican?
603656| probably the worst experience flying. We mistakenly purchased basic economy. At 6’6” and traveling with. 7 month pregnant wife on a flight with 8 comfort plus seats available and willing to pay to upgrade and told no. Unreal you won’t accept $ from consumer for comfort.
603662| is your reservation staff working? we sadly just lost someone in our family  cant get anyone to change this flight tonight
603668| why is your bereavement number the same as regular reservations? Having to wait 2 hours to get answers is not helping.
604658| I am already booked on a flight from mco to lga in January with some family members. What if I want to fly mco to grr instead?
605537| and you once again failed your standards to. Never flying with you again
605544| I’d give anything for you to get season 1  2 of  on the flights, PLEASE! These movies are getting OLD fast!
605547| You have to stop calling the middle seat in Comfort an upgrade.   I would rather stayed in my aisle or window seat in the middle of the plane.
605823| Great job getting us rebooked due to weather conditions in Amsterdam. Excellent customer service today!
606013| Can't select a seat because there aren't any available in my class but I have seats on a connecting flight...?
606352| if you’re in basic economy and if they’re are seats left....can I change it
606365| at the SLC UT terminal waiting to check bags and not one person is working.... flight leaves in an hour?? Day before a holiday, really???
607600| Hi, I have tried to check in online before my flight tomorrow, it says I can’t check in online and need to check in at the airport. Flying Heathrow-NYC how early should I check in? Thanks
607604| ‍️error trying to access wallet ‍️ to obtain receipt 
608634| I booked a flight w KLM through you. My flight to Toulouse was cancelled so we took the train option w stop in Paris. Had to pay for hotel and now we cannot get a response on where luggage is. How can we resolve this and not spend more money on clothes and toiletries
608646| send me a Delta Luggage Tag
608657| folks are coming to visit on 6193 out of RDU. Delayed until 10, but is there a chance of cancellation? They aren't savvy travelers.

609813| why did my position n the stand by list go from 3rd yesterday to 10th today?! I was told I had a good chance of getting on this earlier flight!
611557| Thank you for bring my 19 year old son back home safe   on time to me yesterday from visiting his dad in Texas to the Lehigh Valley in Pa! He never flew alone before. This Momma is extra grateful this holiday! Happy Thanksgiving!️
611570| I’m trying to book a flight by redeeming miles, but I can’t seem to pick a seat. Is this not a option when redeeming miles? I’ve never redeemed miles before, so I’m curious how seating works
611574| my husband promises to NEVER fly with y’all again if all possible!! Flight delayed, NO stewardess??? Red coat mgr, tells him that he must have a attendance problem at work, if he couldn’t take off on Monday for delay!! What disrespect and how rude to judge him, NO DELTA!
611580| Thanks for taking me through so much drama to change my flight to Puerto Rico. My moms 70th b-day is ruined bc of Delta.
611588| I'm at the airport looking at a 5-hour delay, and I'm listening to a woman ripping your agents up one side and down the other. Your people have the patience of saints.
611591| -I just returned from a Roundtrip SAN-MSP-SAN this past Thu-Sun,  for all of the complaining I do about air travel these days,   did a great job. You could just tell the whole crew was working hard to help ensure a pleasurable  efficient trip both ways. #BravoPlus
611595|, just a thank you for your consistency and reliability. Always fly Delta if I can. Recently lost big $$$ when regrettably flying #unitedAIRLINES , missed daughter's event. Lost cost of hotel, tickets time. No word from neglectful airline.

619808| Just a note to tell you and your staff what a GREAT job all of you are doing today!!
620575| I just booked a flight this weekend that said upgrade available for F. But it hasn’t processed. Can you check?

623076| Here I am trying to select a seat and possibly upgrade my seat on a flight that i actually paid for and i am being told i am on standby.. $400+ for a flight that's usually $250 and i am not eligible to sit comfortably? Absurd!!
623188| u blow my mind. I recommend adding "The Ultimate Question 2.0..." to your reading list.
623308| the passenger in 30f of flight 229 was jacking off and leaned his seat back to use his phone as a mirror to look at me. Dm for details. I’m repulsed.
623310| - I chose to be called back 31 minutes later instead of hold. They called back and immediately hung up. Now says 39 more minutes. ??
623314| and male gate agent was kind of a jerk dl4975 out of Houston
623319| please make sure your gate agents are up to date on  regulations regarding musical instruments!

630072| Captain for flight from ATL to SNA is the best yet!  Super friendly! #delta #atl
630084| I just went to check in for my flight tomorrow and my family has been put on standby? Not even at the top, we are 6-10 on the standby list! We booked back in JULY directly through  and we paid cash, no rewards points. How is this possible?
630105| could you please explain why its almost a certainty the plane will not take off on time and that’s acceptable but if a customer has to cancel or is late, they lose the money or the plane will just leave without them
630107| You're likely to get a bunch of complaints today but Benjamin in Burlington, VT was fabulous. Made a bad situation much better.

634160| explain to me how I'm on standby with a full fare ticket? If this is how you're screwing over customers with your new cost breakdown I'm finding a new airline. And if I miss thanksgiving with my family your entire customer service dept will be hearing from me.
634171| I had a flight delayed overnight due to weather, we were told we could get reimbursed for hotel or rental car if we submit the receipts...how do I go about doing that?
634177| how come I still don’t have my eBoarding pass?
634182| really?  You need $2 for a pair of cheap headphones from your Platinum medallion passengers?  Disappointed.  How about customer experience?
634191| broke the cupholder clean out. Now how do I know this is safe for my baby to ride in? 
634194| Is DL4676 delayed or not? I thought I had a little bit of extra time this morning, then I got a call an hour ago saying the flight is on time...

642930| props to gate agents in ATL that just deescalated a confrontation with irate person who was way out of line due to a missed flight.
644258| Quick suggestion -- for your Flight Tracker alert where you send texts when a flight arrives... support non US area codes/numbers.

647238| my wife would like to climb #mtkilimanjaro please add it as a SkyMile Experience!! :) Thank you in advance
647241| your seating assignment process sucks.  You force people to buy tickets for seats that should be assigned upon purchase.
647243| will you be delaying any flights out of Denver due to train issues
647249| should dogs be sitting on your plane seats? 
648416| see you in the morning
648743| could you please help me.  My husband and I are traveling on the same flight to Vancouver but I was upgraded and he was not. He is on the upgrade list
648750| soo frustrating. $116 short. Haven't made status since ur pgm changed in 14. Then changed so I couldn't get comfort + seats bc they aren't ever available as an upgrade anymore! Stop making it harder to earn status!  Ugh! 
648753| thanks to your terminal in Detroit, a pianist is serenading me while I stuff myself with Chick-fil-a. I honestly didn’t believe in heaven until this moment.
648755| Some of the outlets don’t work at ATL gate B4.   Never had this issue with @AmericanAir.

649988| i have a 7 hour delay cuz your plane was missing a part?!?!? That’s fucked and so unprofessional.
650014| has to have the happiest employees in the industry! Keep selecting the right ones and treating them well . People like Holly Hughes make traveling easy.
652270| I don't necessarily mind cancelled flights, i DO mind when you cancel two flights and don't NOTIFY me in either case.
652810| I need help with a flight!!
652812| i was double charged for my checked baggage
653144| Very disappointed, had an emergency that required me to change award flight, cost to change was more in miles and fees than making a new booking! Outrageous!
653147| U have the worst customer service agents at JFK. People with really disgusting attitude  disrespectful. Looks like they want to compete  with United. Smh it just make people want to stop flying with your Airline because of the poor training of your employees.
653543| where do you pay for checked baggage for domestic flights? Trying to finalise booking for JFK to LAX and it says I need to pay 25 for checked bag but no option to do so! Thanks in advance.
654821| Very unhappy about product swap and downgrade of service. Diamond line was rude this morning. Can you help me?
654835| appreciate the comfort+ upgrade, but you should give people the option before doing it automatically. My husband and I would rather sit next to each other in economy than apart and in middle seats in comfort+
654837| Ava in Harrisburg is soo friendly and helpful. Please clone her!
654839| can you add my TAa precheck to my flight ? TSA #: TT1135Z1J 
654843| over a week since I turned in reimbursement receipts @ pdx. I️ just called and ur rep said not processed yet??

656712| will flight 2142 be delayed from Newark to Atlanta tonight?
656744| I wanted to give kudos to Lindsey Stodart from Cincinnati.  She helped me with extra accommodations for my disabled grandmother.  She was an absolute delight to work with and I hope she gets recognition for her excellent customer service!
656746| why does your app not take payment, ur flights always delay, and u don't allow me to pay $75 (crazy) for a standby even though I'm at the gate 35 minutes before departure time. Might have to start bookin  cuz at least they're honest when they wanna kick my ass.
658192| - What's up with serving salad and no salad dressing? None on plane nor on paperwork. LAS-ATL yesterday. 
658262| When it comes to bicycle, will I pay the applicable charge for the first checked bag?
658270| are there any referral bonuses for your Skymiles program?
658276| Thought you may want to know that the Fly Delta app keeps crashing. Moto Z Force user, Android 7.1.1 OS. Not urgent, but might want to shoot IT a note. ️
658278| hey bro ive been at the airport all day waiting for my plane to detroit and you guys have yet to send a replacement what gives im tryna see my fam
658282| shout out to Pramod Mahtami for his superb attention and care! Thank you!!

659620| I just wanted to give your hardworking flight staff a shoutout! Traveling with your airline nationally and internationally is always a treat. The electrical outlets, wifi, and touch screen video displays are great improvements over past amenities. Keep up the good work.
659631| boarded DL5814 at 3:10PM to SNA @ SEA but no sign of flight to fly. 3 announcements made that it will fly in few minutes. Delta flight services going worst day by day. This is 7 time flight delayed of Delta in last 6 months between SNA  SEA
659637| Hats off to Your customer service agent, Dexter from Jamaica.  He was fabulous.  Friendly, helpful and delivered "Best in Class" service!  Give him my thanks! #DeltaAirlines
659639| your crew did an amazing job on both of my flights today! Thanks for making what should’ve been a stressful day of travel an absolute breeze! Happy thanksgiving!
659655| My son was very disappointed on flight DL0946 when he paid $40 for a seat upgrade to 22B and it was just an economy seat closer to the front. The seating app was very misleading in regards to legroom space.
660667| I had to cancel one of my flights last month and want to book a new flight and was wondering if it would be possible to apply the fare difference to my new ticket?
660673| yeah put out some snacks that will make us feel better about the delays that aren't even displayed on the screens and the fact we don't know what's going to happen with our connections #ThanksgivingEve #justtravelthings
660675| Anthony in West Palm sky lounge is the man! So helpful with my seats #delta #skyteam #skylounge
660677| coming through for our missed day with family with a travel voucher. Thank you
660679|  Going home on thanks giving on DL1917 from LGA to TPA as a fucking diamond metalian member who got assigned seat 1A and on boarding time took the seat back! grt reward for flying this stupid airline for 150 times in 2017
660683| you should give pre board privileges if you check your roller bag at the gate.  I checked my roller at the gate at GSP not realizing how long I’d wait at dtw for my bag.  I feel used.
660685| DL 2869 entertainment is pretty boring........ 
660687| - KLM refused checkin for DL9486 this morning - fam of 4 w/ a 1yr old and 3yr old. Rerouted with AA. Horrible day and experience.
660690| any chance you can bring back the funny safety video?
661821| I want to book a flight and prepay my baggage. Is it possible to prepay online or it must be done at the airport? HELP!
661825| a big shout out to Tanya H at PHX Sky Harbor Ticketing. First leg to MSP of Dubai Trip was delayed Sunday, would have missed connection. She spent 90 minutes making it all happen. These pictures don’t happen without her efforts. #Bravo #recognizeher #EmployeeofYear 
661828| Why is Delta flight 421 JFK to SFO being rerouted to LA? For ice?? Will the passengers make it to SFO tonight?
661841| Please give me advice about exporting dog.How can I make flight reservation and bring my dog to the cabin?
661852| always a pleasure doing business with you, also as a suggestion, it would be awesome if you had in your plans upgrading the aircraft in use for your ATL-MEX segments. Thanks.
661862|  Um, $30 for all day wifi? When did this change? That's outrageous, your wifi performance isn't worthy of $30.
662978| How early can I check my bag for my 2:45pm flight out of GCM?
662980| I need to recover my SkyMiles account - it locked while trying to reset the password. Please advise.
662984| Any information you can provide with the computer issue on flight #2293? Flight management system  or GPS? Thanks!
662988| When are you blackout dates for December travel?
662969| trying to help my mother in law get logged into her Skymiles account
662993| Just accidentally booked PM flight instead of AM flight. Tickets are same price. Can I get help to switch them?
662995|  DL1789 is 30+ min behind schedule...will this affect connecting flights in ATL 
663290| shame on Delta for canceling my return flight when I missed my incoming flight.
663300| Extremely poor customer service st SFO intl airport during check-in. Got treated like we didn't matter because we flew economy. Almost refused service once. Boarding a flight angry for the first time in my life. Would think thrice before taking a Delta flight again!
664761| so far I have to say checkin and boarding was very nice. Staff is very sweet onboard. #MXP to  #JFK #AF3554 
664821| Hey, I'm on DL0421 right now. We've been routed away from SFO to LAX -- a little bit out of the way. Is there an update on when we can expect to get into SFO?
666387| Why doesn't the Skymiles Marketplace work?
666390| according to our app my flight was rebooked to tomorrow morning, but I still have a 30 minute layover and it looks like I’m only going from gate B11 to B6. Can I still get on my original flight? DL 2104 to DL 2007
666408| my miles got credited to my Air France account instead of my Delta sky-miles account. How can I change that? Thanks
666414| Dropping bag in LAX flying to SEA - boarding pass for term 2. Delta priority bag drop off at term 2. Regular bag drop off at term 3, then walk back. WTF. Just try losing my bag after this.
666416| ..thank you so much for awesome flights last Friday and yesterday!!  Customer service was awesome
667919| my KTN isn’t appearing on my boarding pass. Have confirmed the number is correct. Can you please help?
667929| YOU LOST MY BAG, IT DIDNT EVEN MAKE IT UP TO BAGGAGE CLAIM!
667932|  your Ipad app is absolutely dreadfull- slow and unresponsive.  Back to the drawing board !
668737| SUCKS. Stuck in Atlanta again for the hundredth time and they could give two shits about it! Hundreds of thousands of miles over the years and I am done with them!  We’re to leave at 8:30-NOW 3:30. Not even sorry about it so pissed i can’t see right now. #DeltaSucksBigTime
668754| you did it. 4 for 4 on flights this week on the grand stage of traveling weeks. This thumbs up is for you.  #attaboy #thatsmygirl #patontheback #tassleofthehair #youdaman #wonderwomen #highfive Thanks.

668760| I’m still miffed about your increase in WiFi pricing, but the crew on delayed DL1132 was pretty incredible and kept things fun tonight. Kudos to them! 
668765| you bumped me from my transatlantic bulkhead that I booked months ago? #sad
669366| bought new suitcase in Playacar baggage broke my other one just got home brand new one is ripped and stained!
669368| can you help me understand why they've taken away a PDX to LAX flight tomorrow that was supposed to leave at 6:46 and moved it 4:00, messing up Thanksgiving? Your phone support told me the change happened in Sept but my agent confirmed original flight in November
669371| this is the 3rd time this year my seat isn’t capable of reclining on your flights. 
669376| , I'm completely appalled how I was treated as a consumer that valued your airline and service on a higher level than I was shown. I was offered a voucher for free coffee. Sorry  , but I don't drink coffee and I don't think what I been through coffee will cover it.
669378|  how will I know when my free companion ticket is available for use? Do I get notified?
669386| I just realized I left my iPad on my flight 2327. Who do I need to contact?
669849| when your it systems are talking BS: on approach jfk-lax and you get a notification “your bag has been loaded on lax-syd” - time to fix a bug :) 
669853| I bought my wife a ticket next week to come to Denver with me using miles. Now I can upgrade my seat to first class with $ but I can't do the same for her. Any options to get us both in first class still?

670632| I swear if my flight DL946 is cancelled and you cost me a chance to see my family for Thanksgiving, I will never fly your Airline ever again.
670634| Hello! My flight is tomorrow and I don’t want to check-in any bags. Can I have a perfume that’s a 100 ml and a laptop in my carry-on bag? And is there a limit for the amount of perfumes I can carry with me?
671436| Can't BELIEVE you couldn't hold 1094 from ATL - OKC long enough for a late connection due to pilot no-show on 523 from CVG - ATL. My friend and son ran all the way to gate, missed by a couple of minutes. SHAME.
671438| thank you so much for upgrading me to first class on my flight to Kalispell, Montana to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Best flight ever! #FirstClass #DeltaAirlines #Montana #Minnesota #upgrade
671452| I'm gonna have to eat my words. I complained earlier about a lack of service, but I deleted that. Got bumped UP to an earlier flight instead of staring down the barrel of waiting at the airport for another several hours. 
671454| 
671465| Flight 358 this morning from LAX to MCO was excellent. Of course, having seat 1C didn’t hurt. Special thanks to F.A. Michelle who went above and beyond to be helpful. Tell her Ralph said thanks. (I don’t usually fly Delta)

673382| Hello! Do you happen to have a Delta store ? I'm planning a party for a kid who loves Delta and would love to buy him some stuff!
673385| you sent an email saying to be here 2 hours before my flight . . . still nobody working at 4:22 am.
676381| yes, I understand that pilots too can call in sick, but to not have one lined up and cause the flight to be delayed by 1 hour or more... Is unacceptable. We have a connecting flight we have to catch...
676390| it seems today’s DL 167 from Tokyo-Narita to Singapore is cancelled. Are there any replacement flights for it? Or will tomorrow’s flight be upsized?
676393|’s a mess this AM. Seats unassigned, crazy lines, and now folks luggage won’t fit in overhead bins. #Turkeydaytravel
676396| there are never connecting flights available from USA to CWB via GRU on problem.
676852| I just transferred Amex points to Skymiles. The transaction went through, but I can't use the miles yet. How long until I can?

680075| Hi ! Which terminal for fly Montreal to Atlanta today at 5:50am please?
680078| Just got off the phone with one of your help desk reps, Shawna I believe was her name. Outstanding service, another reason this airlines is the best, if you award gold stars or perks, give her two!
680088| I️t is best to inform your customers the reason why you have a flight delayed and why the delayed flight is still not underway, at said time. We “the customer is the reason you’re in business. SFO. #corpgotittwisted
682308| I messed up my reservation online. I need assistance!

688205| when do you think you’ll fix your flight search feature on the website for customers in the UK? Getting nonstop errors.
688209| thank you so much for stranding my husband in Atlanta this morning. I’m so thankful for the opportunity to see my kids hurt when I tell them their Dad won’t be able to make Thanksgiving.
688232| do I need to start this all over with you too??? ‍️ it's #thanksgiving for goodness sake!! He still needs his flt to get back HNL and you wanna charge him $200 cancellation fee? #ridiculous #poorservice #deltasucks

688432| nothing better than a crabby, bossy flight attendant... Flight 1971 to Charleston.  Another reason I've changed my airline preference
688765| What do you do when your touch screen TV has a mind of its own, leaving you with no entertainment for your 5 hour flight? #worstcasescenario 
689656| Happy Thanksgiving, guys! Quick question. I've got a "US 49" upgrade certificate that expires in December of this year. Does that mean it has to be used on travel before that date, or can I apply it now to a future itinerary after the expiration date? #complexquestion

703391| More $$$ for shorter routes? I'm trying to book a IND-SCL flight, that goes through ATL, but on the way back I only need SCL-ATL; resulting in +$1K multi-city fare per ticket. Even a round trip ATL-SCL is x2 $$$ than IND-SCL. 11/29-12/6 flex. Optically and logically wrong!
704911| employees from seattle, carla “with a c”  david a., were the rudest people i have ever met  deliberately made us miss our flight home for thanksgiving. we were at the gate in time  were booked on the flight. they would not take our tickets  slammed the door in our face

890630| Thanks to Kevin Lai in Atlanta! For outstanding support!
890634| when you "partner" with another airline maybe you should bother to treat your premium flyers with respect (and also instruct your "partners" to do the same).  Apparently, platinum gets you a middle seat from LHR to JFK on VA. Thanks  for another total botched flight
890650| need answers re flight and seat
890652| your garbage  baggage employees in IND stole 14 of 24 priceless pennies from an advent calendar that my father was giving my son.  New low.  contact me for details.  Gross! We are devastated

891268| thank you very much for responding, don't think those prices are possible . Way cool you responded tho.

891720| flying son Delta tomorrow.  Hope I don’t have to worry about #bedbugs. #travel 
891723| is the crew going to time out on DL4809 MSP-RDU? This delay is getting silly
891731| It would be great, if we'd get our baggage back instead of survey E-Mails!
891737| charging 200 usd when you just cancel just one leg of the trip... that’s really annoying.
891844| horrible day. Boarded, deplaned for 1 hour, reboarded, 2 hour delay on the runway. Smelled and felt like a big fart... CC 
891848| change flight option is not working on website. I get a page error. Any info?
893042| You're my favorite airline. But the boarding process is anxiety and chaos. How about screens clearly displaying boarding group?
893045| 2nd time in 3 weeks you delayed/canceled my flight in/out of the same airport.  Now there’s a 2+ hour wait for help. Get it together
893536| I upgraded my ticket for a trip on November 10th and it charged my account 10 times... call me delta. Your hold is too long
893540| Hello - I am having some trouble redeeming an ECERT. Can you assist? Thanks so much!

895307| how can I make a flight reservation changeable as well as refundable before making a booking?

904411| Back in August I paid for two Delta Comfort seats on LHR to BOS at a charge of £69 each and all was ok. On checking today the seats have been moved back to main cabin and I am being asked to pay again. Cant get any help from Delta - is there anyone at Delta that can help?

904473| trying to book a flight, tried it 4 times and it won’t. SOS

904479|  I love you guys, and your customer service but today I had one of the worst experiences with one of your employees. Super dissapointed, she did not represent your brand well.
904772| I flew DL0967 on 10/18 and DL2536 on 10/20. Seat 21A the recline button on the seat is broke. You might want to let maintenance know

905357|. Our flight attendant Jim on our flight today was amazing! He deserves major kudos #Delta #flydelta #flydeltajets #keepclimbing
905542| Please contact me regarding upcoming trip. Seat was assigned for return trip, but not outbound...makes no sense.
905544| hello! Why the delay for DL2765 from PHX to JFK?
906707| If there is a ban on laptops I will freak out. We've used them for years and it's clearly an attack to boost cellphone sales.

907136| stuck in stupid Cincinnati missing my own B-Day party. #NotImpressed

907571| MANY MANY thanks to DL agents Juliet and Donny who have been kind,patient and who helped this very tired travel agent️️️
907573| truly amazed with our experience today. Flight attendants were actually happy..had more than enough food to get thru a 5 hr flight
907579| passing along some feedback. The new gate monitor style in conc A in #ATL makes it very difficult to see the current time from afar
908051| your company is despicable. I’m sure your flight is full and this is what you charge the distressed ppl of PR #pricegouging #ripoff 
908056| you guys fucking suck
908059| you left our bag in Orlando, now no clothes for our show tonight. Would have been nice to be alerted, now rushing!
908330| I need to tell you that Brian, a skycap working at MCO at 1:00pm this afternoon, is wonderful.  I ... 
908333| Marilyn the gate agent for DL004 is LAS is nothing short of amazing.  Value to the brand and wonderful spirit!  Kudos to her!
908369| thirty people in line to just drop bags in BOS and three agents? And no bagdrop line? Not very productive.
908371| please don’t change our tickets to another connection city when there are many seats available on orig. Waiting hours for call back.
908566| thanks for not having enough chicken in first class #allergictoshrimp #wasteoffirstclass
908571| 950 flight to ROC on a  Friday (took off at 1030) after hard days work and can't buy a beer, how lazy are these flight attendants?
908575|  how do I send kudos for an employee who went above and beyond?  My conf number and my last reserve should ID her. Alicia rocked!!
908653| Just noticed on my ATL-SJU on 12/2, my seat assignment is no longer on my res.  Website wont allow me to add it. Hold time 50+min
909001| had to sprint to make flight bc of delay  the check-in woman was so rude to me for barely making it as I was sweating. Awful service
909005| are you by any chance issuing travel waivers for SFO if your weekend to Napa can't happen anymore?
909160| love you guys, but you've got to get the ground crew issues resolved at CLE. Always waiting for the ground crew has become the norm.

912604| you absolutely suck
913012| didn't even offer a flight voucher or hotel after canceling flight last min.  Best they could do was a bus?
913025| A huge shout out to Bridget and Lavinda on #DL1631 LAX / DCA for a phenomenal Delta One service. Amazing LAX based FAs. #DM #greatday
913027| Got email to check in.  Tried to check in but it says I have duplicate flights?  Help?
913033| I hate your app. Fly a lot, almost gold. Never had a flight where the app didn't screw me up. You need a new IT Dept.
913035| Flying tomorrow with 2-year-old. Ticket says "seat assigned at gate". Advice? He really can't sit on his own.
913039| How do I uncheckin for a flight? My travel agent can't make the change because I've already checked in
913044| made me check my bag because they were out of baggage space. #liars #badcustomerservice @SouthwestAir wouldn't try that nonsense. 
913403| pretty sure this flight i make diamond for the first time.
913552| your inflight info system is drunk. Good thing the pilot got the destination right 
913554| what a fun way to start our honeymoon. Thoughtful employee took this pic at PWM. This is my first tweet ever! ENGAGE! 
913722| has Delta considered adding flights from CLT Charlotte to BOS Boston?
