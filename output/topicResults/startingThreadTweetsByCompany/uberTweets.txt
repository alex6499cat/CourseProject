70000|  I just ride with Uber and lost my mobile in cab, cab booked by 9811683368. Pls help
70654| I can never use promo codes that I'm given by uber and friends for both uber eats and uber - please assist!
70664| Not happy! Had an uber eats guy wake the household up at 12:30am with a delivery. After telling him he had the wrong address and trying to explain for a few minutes with him getting more and more aggressive he finally stormed off! Can drivers not check the address!?
72038|  promo code sapphire?lyiv7q. Max. discount per ride is INR 50.  Can u write promo code in inverted commas pls.

73682| , hi, driver made argument and said that he will not go to Airport. After sometime, he cancelled. Plz do not deduct amount from my pocket.

141542|  Its been a week since I was charged a extra charge on my account and still have not received my money back and to add more problems, uber took out another additional charge and claims they will return both. Clearly uber does not care about their customers.

167321| Having major issues and cannot get any customer service. I left my phone in the drivers car and she said she was going to mail it to me, but been to many days. How can I get help!! I have been waiting on her to call me back. Please help.
167352| hi there, my account has been hacked. Please advise.
168928|  How long is the wait to reset a password. I left my iPhone in my Uber and I want to contact the driver ASAP. URGENT
168945|  I’ve just been charged by a driver and he hasn’t even turned up...
168951|   I have never wasted so much time with a support: they do not understand the issue (basic additions) and do not fix it - 4 days to exchange stupid message with a new agent on each - a nightmare .
170414| my driver hit a neighbours Mercedes. He never left his details when he got out. I found out because he came asking if I owned
170418| so if I cancel a car for being 20 minutes away I get charged. If this knob cancels when he’s outside making me late for work that’s fine?!  
170424| it doesn’t say any of those things please help resolve my issue as I’m stranded
170435| Ubereats has the wrong address.  My retail store is not a thai food place.  How do we correct this?
171794| I like the uber eats i just tried it today. happy with how it went. kinda bummed that because i tried it once without a coupon i cant use a promo code now kinda of a dick move to anyone who doesn't look through the entire app for a promo spot before their 1st order
171828|  Hi Support Team.  Please help me to generate my Invoices. Im using the new Mexico Invoice System and i cant loggin in bc you dont send me the verification code via SMS.
171837| Why is it so consistently hard to get picked up? I clearly mark where I am on an accessible side street. I'm told to meet drivers at pick up points in the middle of busy main roads. It just doesn't make sense.
171848| Been trying to get an Uber for 15 minutes. Keep getting "error processing your request." Maybe I'll try 
171862| I don't even know how to express my disappointment in you guys. Utterly shameful
174181| you guys gave me a promo code and it keeps on saying not a valid code. That's NOT cool
174187| - my driver has changed 8 times and I had to get a taxi as I'm late for my night bus. I can't cancel the uber in the app. Not sure what im supposed to do..
174194| I have several fraudulent charges on my card adding up to over $300. Contacted a representative and all they did was ask to confirm pick up/drop off locations of FRAUDULENT charges. Are y’all gonna help me get my money back or do I need to contact my lawyer?
174201| can you provide some certification for drivers attempting anything near Trafalgar Square/Whitehall? Multiple cancels or 15+ minute delays because a single roundabout is too much for some drivers.
174203| I need my $3.56 back. One of your drivers canceled my ride because he wasn’t at the pick up location, and had he audacity to tell me I’m the one who wasn’t there.
175007| Last night I took an uber ride for the first time and the driver dropped me around the corner instead in front of my brothers house, I was lost in the dark! Had to phone brother.On the ride home the 1st uber driver never showed up and charge a $5.00 fee. Fix this.
175016| nice one you guys couldn't give two shits.
175020| @AskLyftAre we responsible for making passengers have seatbelts on? Or is it on themselves since their the ones who would receive the ticket
175035| I’m using your messaging system to deal with fraud on my acct  getting no where. What number can I call? This is ridiculous.
175037| my free delivery code is saying it's not valid....solutions?
175039| I have all my documents uploaded. It asks for my vehicle information. I put in information.
175042|  intentionally prevents riders from getting urgent assistance when valuables are left in their cars in order to enable drivers to steal. Instead of being able to connect with a driver ASAP you are forced to wait hours, possibly days.
176049| my ride pass didn’t auto renew this past month and in-app support hasn’t been able to renew it. Send help! 
176072| such unprofessional drivers you hire!The worst service I have ever had in recent times. Your driver was unprofessional and inturn I had to shell out money for it!Shame on you!
177059|   Charges twice please help 
177066| I can't log into my uber account. For some reason it keeps telling me my phone number is already in use
177071| what on gods green earth does a rider complaint "comfort" mean? And why wasnt i notified of a complaint when it happened?
177073| I left my phone in a car. How do I get it back? Can't access my account (no phone) + verification codes going to my phone.
177075| Can you please explain why ive been charged a £25 cleaning fee when the car was completely fine when i left it ?
177082| I am a rider in Perth Australia. I need to change the credit card I use. I can load a new one in and the app accepts it. But when I try to book a ride it refuses to let me do it saying "your profile's payment method is invalid. please use another one". Uuh?
177871| I was recently deactivated from UBER due to background check issue. Then I got an email a few days ago saying there might be an error, we are working on it. Now I got an email saying that they are going to run a background check but I just it done last month...
177880| your driver in Cardiff charged me before he'd got to me, hung up while on the phone to me then had the cheek to yell at me when he finally got to me. London drivers are much better. Refund pls!
177888| so in an uber pool we can drive past my destination for another passenger?
177892| ‍️ SECURITY BREACH ‍️Seems someone in Austria is using  to defraud my credit card. 
177904| uber driver just looked at my emoational support animal, asked if we had a carrier, said yes, she shut her window and sped off.  Left us hanging out in the cold @ LaGuardia airport.  Unacceptable
177918| please what does this mean? The driver never picked me up and you send me this after how many minutes of waiting... 
181576| I can't change my credit card details as a rider. I think my account may be part set up as a driver -which I changed my mind about. Can my account be changed to be a rider only and maybe that will overcome the issues I'm getting with changing my credit card details?
181578| driver just canceled my trip even though I've been waiting outside for 15 minutes. I was charged a cancellation fee, can that be refunded?
181580| Hi, Is there luggage restrictions in ubergo for a single passenger? I booked ubergo...uberx came and he charged me extra for luggage saying new policy? Please confirm.
181598| my driver cancelled on me because they got lost, charged me $6 and I only get a $5 credit back? I paid for someone to waste my time?
181600| on a recent ride I was not emailed a receipt. The app doesn't give me the option to have the receipt emailed to me. Any suggestions?
181607| $16.77 of my uber gift card is gone I ordered UberEATS but it was deducted from credit card ?????

470959|  your driver refused to drive me down and left me  stranded at the airport!! For this pathetic service you are saying 157 amount is pending?? 
471612| I don't use your app much which is why I wrongly scored a driver 1 star instead of 5 ... Can I get that corrected somehow? He was a lovely chap.
471619|  I get that you completely depend on the app navigation but if there are two ways to get to a destination, learn to accept the route which makes more sense even if it’s NOT the suggested one.. sometimes eyes on ground make more sense..!!!
471621| my driver didn’t end the journey when I got out the car. It took me to message and call (he cut me off), but it still cost me extra.
471631| Such a pathetic service you are giving us. We booked for Uber pool from Marathalli till Vydehi. But they have to pick up others and we had been roaming around Marathalli for almost 1 hour. How can you guys pick up someone who is not even on the ongoing route.1/2
471633| I was charged twice for something when I ordered from UberEATS. I sent you guys an email but you don’t respond. RIDICULOUS

577382| In fact besides UBER app your company has miserably failed in checking the high handedness of your drivers. In fact, they are using your app along with their own policies where to go and where to refuse.
578080| fix your fucking app to stop sending "drivers completing nearby trips". Im going to miss my flight because of the 20 minute wait time.
578083|  I have an issue with my second last ride today as the fare shown before  was different and the fare after the ride was more . Even after complaining about it I still didn't get any support . I need my refund . My uber number is 9121474701.
578098| Then literally a minute after the latest agent has replied to my question with the same canned response, a good agent named John finally knows how to read and gives me a refund. So PSA: 1/4 agents at  actually read your message. #BoycottUber #WorstSupportEver 
578777| My account is not allowing me to book a ride or delete my account. Can you please assist to remedy my account as it is imperative that I book an important ride. PLEASE HELP.

594042| I have lost my phone. I can't login to my account (due to 2FA) and I need to contact the driver about whether the phone was left in the vehicle.
594047| the fact that your app tells me I have mock locations and rooting in my phone when I don't; but then suggests that I need to get a note 8 to fix it is not even cool. #frustrated
594049|  I have called a driver and emailed uber multiple times about lost items and still won’t get a response. What do I do?
594039| hey I read on your website that your delivery fee for Uber Eats is $4.99 but it's coming up as $19.96 for me. Any reason for this?

679976| passenger had 5 people total. There was a surge promotion of 2.8 and they made a wrong adjustment. You guys robbed me literally. The x fare should be  29.47 and that should be adjusted to xl 
679980| I don't speed have no History of tickets and I'm surprised that I was sent a message today about my driving. At a loss. And that goes to show you that some of your riders aren't always the source for feedback as many of them are in a bad mood to begin with.
